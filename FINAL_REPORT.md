**Date:** May 2023

### Abstract
Quick Doodle is a real-time collaborative drawing game that integrates AI sketch recognition for a modern take on Pictionary. Players take turns drawing while an AI system automatically recognizes the sketches and awards points based on recognition speed and accuracy. The project combines a React frontend, Node.js real-time backend, and Python/TensorFlow AI service to create a seamless multiplayer experience.

## 1. Introduction & Motivation

### Problem Statement
Traditional drawing games require human judgment to determine if a sketch matches the intended subject, which can lead to disagreements and subjective scoring. Additionally, existing online sketch games often lack the real-time collaboration features that make in-person drawing games engaging.

### Why It Matters
- **AI-Powered Objectivity**: AI sketch recognition provides an impartial judge for drawing quality
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Socket.IO enables immediate feedback and multi-player interaction
- **Educational Value**: Gamifies machine learning concepts and demonstrates practical AI application

### Course Learning Objectives Addressed
- Application of deep learning techniques to real-world problems
- Design and deployment of end-to-end machine learning systems
- Development of real-time web applications
- Multidisciplinary integration of frontend, backend, and AI technologies

### Course Topics and Implementation

This project implements two core AI topics from the course curriculum:

1. **Neural Networks**: 
   Our implementation leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sketch recognition:
   
   - **MobileNetV2 Architecture**: We implemented a lightweight CNN architecture based on MobileNetV2 that achieves 92.36% validation accuracy while maintaining fast inference speed (15ms) and small model size (9MB).
   
   - **Transfer Learning**: We applied transfer learning by using pre-trained ImageNet weights and adapting the network for our sketch recognition task, significantly reducing training time and improving accuracy.
   
   - **Model Optimization**: We employed post-training quantization to reduce our model size by approximately 74% (from 35MB to 9MB) while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for web deployment.

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
   We implemented a practical machine learning workflow:

   - **Data Processing**: We built a pipeline for the Google Quick Draw dataset that converts raw stroke data to normalized 28×28 raster images suitable for our CNN.
   
   - **Two-Phase Training**: Our training approach freezes the base layers initially while training only the classification head, then fine-tunes selected layers for optimal accuracy.
   
   - **Web-Based Inference**: We created a Flask API service that handles real-time sketch recognition requests from our game server, demonstrating practical ML deployment in a production-like setting.

Our implementation demonstrates the practical application of neural networks and machine learning in a real-time gaming context, creating an engaging user experience that showcases the capabilities of modern AI systems.

## 5. Model Design & Training

### Model Architecture Selection

Our project implements a MobileNetV2-based architecture with transfer learning for optimal performance and efficiency:

#### MobileNetV2-based Transfer Learning (Selected for Deployment)
An optimized model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture with alpha=0.75:

- Adapted for single-channel grayscale input
- Fine-tuned on QuickDraw dataset
- Post-training quantization to reduce size
- 92.36% validation accuracy
- 9MB model size
- Average inference time: 15ms

### Training Approach

#### Phase 1: Classification Head Training
- Froze base MobileNetV2 layers
- Trained only the classification head for 20 epochs
- Learning rate: 0.001 with step decay
- Batch size: 64
- Achieved initial 87% validation accuracy

#### Phase 2: Fine-tuning
- Unfroze top 30% of base model layers

The confusion matrix for the deployed MobileNetV2 model shows particularly strong performance on distinctive categories like "airplane," "star," and "umbrella", while occasionally confusing visually similar categories like "cat"/"dog" and "car"/"bus".

## 6. API & Backend Implementation

### AI Service API
The AI service exposes two main endpoints:

#### `/api/recognize` Endpoint
- **Request**: Base64-encoded image data from canvas
- **Processing**:
  1. Decode image and preprocess to 28×28 pixels
  2. Normalize pixels to 0-1 range
  3. Run inference through TensorFlow model
  4. Extract top predictions with confidence scores
- **Response**: JSON with top 5 predictions and confidence scores

#### `/api/status` Endpoint

- Timer starts (60 seconds per round)
- Drawer creates sketch, others see in real-time
- AI analyzes drawing periodically

3. **Recognition and Scoring**:
- AI evaluates drawing every 1-3 seconds
- Points awarded based on how quickly AI recognizes the drawing
- Early recognition (≤10s): 90-100 points
- Late recognition (≥50s): 10-20 points

4. **Turn Rotation**:
- Round ends when AI recognizes drawing or time expires
- Scores updated and displayed to all players
- Next player becomes drawer with new word options
- Game ends after all rounds or when host ends game

### AI Integration Flow

- Canvas converted to 224×224 image
- Image encoded as base64

2. **Prediction Request**:
- Image data sent to server
- Server forwards to AI service
- AI service returns predictions

3. **Prediction Processing**:
- Top predictions displayed to drawer
- Server checks if current word matches prediction
- If match found, score calculated and round ends
- Auto-advance to next turn after brief delay
